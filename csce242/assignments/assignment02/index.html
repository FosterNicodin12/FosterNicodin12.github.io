            <h2>League Leaders</h2>
            <p>The offensive side of the ball was littered with players shocking the fans with performances and the well known players continuing their success.  The league leader in passing yards and passing 
                touchdowns is Joe Burrown who unfortunately missed the playoffs due to some early season losses.  His number one reciever Jamarr Chase won the triple crown.  This means he led the league in 
                recieving yards, recieving touchdowns and receptions.  He is the 13th to ever complete this feat, we also had our 9th ever 2000 yard rusher who is Saquan Barkley.
            </p>
            <p>On defense we had many new names as league leaders.  Zaire Franklin led the league in tackles who has been close the past couple of years but finally beat out Bobby Wagner and Foyesade Oluokun.
                The leader in interceptions is Kerby Joseph who is a young ball hawk who edged out the vetern Xavier McKinney by one.  The sacks leader is another Bengal to match his offensive counterparts with 
                Burron and Chase, Trey Hendrickson led the league with 17.5 sacks.
